# Admin Panel

<div aligin="center">
I had a homework about database.I wanted to make a different project. That's why I decided to make a web project but I didn't know about Asp.Net MVC.
I have tried to make a admin panel which add catagory, products, customers and sales control. When I started this project, I didn't know anything about backend.
Anyway Sum up, when I made this project , I learned many componentes and That's got me very happy.
In addition, I used HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and Bootstrap 4 for frontend. Generally for backend I used Asp.NET MVC with Entity framework database first approches because this way was easy for connect MSSQL.
